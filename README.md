## :wave: Welcome to my github!
You can find my side projects here. Some projects are done for my studies and the rest I do in my free time.
Most of them are written in C++, It is my favorite programming language.
Of course there are also projects written in Python, Java and in other languages.

## :information_source: About me 
My name is Marcin Putra. I live in Pozna≈Ñ but I came from Suwa≈Çki - very cold city in north-west Poland.
I am a person who loves competition and has many passions:
- :video_game: Computer games
  I received my first computer for Christmas in 2004, along with the computer I received the Techland game "Pet Racer".
  I immediately fell in love with computer games, I spent entire days in the map editors of various games. 
  To this day, I love playing, creating levels/entire games.

- :soccer: Football/Futsal
  My dad gave me this passion and I've been training football as a goalkeeper since I remember.
  During my studies, I gave up playing in the club but I still play football with friends.
  
- :volleyball: Beach volleyball
  The second sports passion appeared in high school, my best friend invited me to play during the holidays and I really liked it. 
  I'm very tall so I made a lot of progress in the beginning. I love going to tournaments and competing with others.

- :keyboard: Programming
  The last biggest passion is programming. I wrote first "Hello World" in C++ in 2015.
  It turned out that understanding code came very easily to me. I started writing more and more code and then I decided to study computer science.
