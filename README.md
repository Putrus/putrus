## :wave: Welcome to my github!
You can find my side projects here. Some projects are done for my studies and the rest I do in my free time.
Most of them are written in C++, It is my favorite programming language.
Of course there are also projects written in Python, Java and other languages.

## :information_source: About me 
My name is Marcin Putra. I live in Pozna≈Ñ but I come from Suwa≈Çki - very cold city in north-west Poland.
I'm a software engineer, student and teacher.
I am a positive, chatty and extroverted person who is very ambitious. I love working in a team and compete with others.
I've tried a lot of things in my life and I have many passions:
<details>
<summary>:video_game: Computer games</summary>
I received my first computer for Christmas in 2004, in the same time I got the Techland game "Pet Racer".
I immediately fell in love with games and I spent whole days in the map editors of various games.
To this day, I love playing and creating games, so from time to time I take part in game jam contests.

<summary>:soccer: Football/Futsal</summary>
My dad gave me this passion and I've been training football as a goalkeeper since I remember.
During my studies, I gave up playing in the club but I still play football with friends.

<details>
<summary>:volleyball: Beach volleyball</summary>
The second sports passion appeared in high school, my best friend invited me to play during the holidays and I really liked it. 
I'm very tall so I made a lot of progress at the beginning. I love going to tournaments and competing with others.

<details>
<summary>:keyboard: Programming</summary>
The last but not least passion is programming. I wrote first "Hello World" in C++ in 2015.
It turned out that writing code is very satisfied and understanding it came very easily to me.
I started writing more and more and then I decided to study computer science.
